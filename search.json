Figure from the Internet Archive Book Images\n\n\n\nSee also my list of mistakes.\nTo find errors in my work, I try to make my analyses reproducible, and rely on a few best practices borrowed from the software industry, such as version control, code review, testing, and sanity checks. Still, given that I do not always have co-authors who have the time and ability to review my code, I am looking for other ways to find and correct errors in my work.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Get him. Figure from the Internet Archive Book Images\n\n\n\nPutting up an anonymous submission form only yielded one measly submission (although a good one, which led to an erratum in Proceedings B, because it turned out the journal published a later version than the one I quoted and commented on).\nStepping on people’s toes with my work yielded more, but it’s not a practice I want to institutionalise.\nBug bounties\nSo, I’m borrowing another practice from software: a bug bounty program.1 I’m slightly less well funded than Google and their ilk, but the Free Knowledge Fellow program by Wikimedia and the Stifterverband endowed me with some money to use for open science projects and this is how I choose to spend half of it.\nSo, what does this apply to, and what can you earn?\nCriteria\nI’m first author or the other authors ask me to include it in the bug bounty program.2\nIt’s an empirical manuscript3\npreprints count for the full amount (until they are accepted)\npublished papers count for 3/4 the amount\nblog posts count for 1/4 the amount unless they are tagged quick job4\n\nIt was published after October 2, 2018.5\nThe different factors for preprints, publications, and blogs reflect the amount of effort I already put in them and how easy it will be for me to correct something at that point. So, because I would love to hear about errors before the publication processes “enshrines” the paper6, errors in preprints are worth more than those in published paper.\nBudget\nFor now, I’m setting aside 2500€. When this runs out, I’ll have to a) improve my error checking workflow, b) get another stipend, award, donation, or tenured position, so I can afford continuing to make errors. I’ll keep this page updated, so should my budget have run out, you won’t waste too much time.\nWithin at most two months of the bug being reported, I’ll pay out the sum via Paypal or bank transfer or argue my case why it was not a bug. In severe cases, or if I’m ill, or out of work, it might take me longer, in these cases I will post a note quoting the bug report and my intention to respond. In all cases, I will post a note on this page, in more severe cases, I will start the process of submitting a correction, or a retraction. I cannot give a timeline on these because of co-authors.\nIf you report a bug anonymously, I will donate the fee to Against Malaria via the German Equivalent of Give Well. You can also choose a different charity on the GiveWell list. You can also choose to donate if you do not report anonymously.7\nBounties\nItem\nBounty\nTypos\nA beer8 if we meet.\nOmitted citations\nA beer9 if we meet.\nLacking reproducibility10\n10€\nCoding error that changes a number reported in the supplement\n10€\nLacking robustness11\n20€\nCoding error that changes a number reported in the manuscript, but not a conclusion based on the number\n50€\nA better way to statistically model or test something that leads to a different conclusion\n100€\nCoding error that changes a conclusion in the manuscript\n200€\nCoding error that changes the main conclusion in the abstract\n400€\nI will count the errors (by type, not by repetitions), not the numbers, or conclusions changed.\nPlease note that these bounties do not necessarily reflect only the gravity of a bug (i.e., missing a citation can be pretty bad), but also my perception which of these are actually determinable objectively. So, by reducing the sum for omitting citations, I hope to forestall drawn-out arguments by reducing both sides’ temptation to bargain.\nAny one person can claim at most 5 items, so up to 760€. If multiple people notice the same error, second and third reporters only get a beer, and my heartfelt gratitude.\nThis policy could change anytime without notice.\nPlease help!\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Help me master my bugs.

Open, reproducible science is important to me, so I focus on methods, measures, and transparency and dabble in research software development. I live in Berlin and work at the University of Leipzig.\nYou can reach me at ruben.arslan@gmail.com or on Twitter. If you want to tell me I’m wrong about something anonymously, you can use this form.1 I also have a standing bug bounty policy for errors in my published work.\nPublications\nHere’s a PDF of my curriculum vitae. All my work is at least green open access and you can find direct links to each publication in this PDF (click on the green/orange lock icons). You can also find my publications on my Google Scholar profile. Below are the two main graphs from the two main papers of my dissertation. You can click on them to view the websites I usually create to document my analyses and results.\n\n\n \n\n\nBlogs\nTogether with three wonderful people, I founded The 100% CI, a blog focused on open science and meta science. Posts that I wrote primarily, can be found here, although we all edit and review each other. My personal blog features some small analyses, simulations, post-publication criticism, and accounting for errors in my work. The blog’s name (One lives only to make blunders) is taken from this famous letter from Darwin to Lyell.\nOpen Science\nI’m a child of the reproducibility crisis in psychology - I had to unlearn much of what I was taught. To me, the open science movement is our best hope to fight the corruption of science. I occasionally give talks and workshops to advertise and teach tools and methods to do better work, including some of the software listed below.\nBad Science vs. Open Science\nThe replication crisis and possible reforms. This is my main introductory talk that I have given in Greifswald, Copenhagen, Berlin, and Göttingen. I try to take slightly less than half of the time for the problems, and slightly more than half for the solutions.\nAbstract\n\nEstimates from large-scale replication projects in psychology suggest that the majority of studies from top journals do not have replicable results. In related news, researchers were able to publish highly significant support for impossible phenomena using commonly accepted scientific research methods. Data detectives keep finding highly cited scientific papers that are riddled with errors invalidating their conclusions. Our textbooks are full of findings that do not replicate or are in serious doubt. Publication bias and outcome switching contaminate our knowledge base about pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatment. Science as a system has issues, but can we use the scientific method to remedy them? A vibrant reform movement is seeking to do so, but it can be hard to keep track of all the suggestions to do better. I outline concrete plans and paths that could lead to lasting improvements, such as the Open Science Framework, Registered Reports, the Peer Reviewer’s Openness Initiative, the All Trials initiative, preprints, post publication peer review, and guideline and incentive setting at the journal, hiring and funding level.\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkshop on FAIR metadata\nAbstract\n\nGoogle now also finds datasets – but will it find yours? How can you share your data in such a way that it will be useful to you and others in the future? Some scientific disciplines have found ways to store data in standardised formats in central, open repositories. But for many, especially in health and human subjects research, data cannot be shared openly. You can always share metadata – but how do you do so in a forward-thinking way? We discuss standards or the lack of them and try out practical tools.\n\n\n\n\n\nformr workshop\nAbstract\n\nThe survey framework formr.org is a free, open source software for online and lab studies. Even with little or no programming skills users can design complex studies. Key features include automatic email and text message reminders for repeated surveys on computers and smartphones and the automatic generation of personalised graphical feedback based on R functions. Designed by and for personality researchers, formr.org makes it easy to collect peer ratings, social networks, dyadic and round robin data, longitudinal, and experience sampling data. It also allows for separation of contact and study data as required by European privacy laws. Users of formr.org can increase the transparency and reproducibility of their research by sharing and version tracking complete study workflows. Furthermore, data collected with formr.org can be cleaned and documented in human- and machine-readable codebooks without additional effort by relying on the study metadata.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaintaining privacy with open data\nAbstract\n\nIn this workshop, we will try to tackle questions about privacy in the age of big and open data. Why should we even share our data? For what kind of research data do we need to maintain privacy? What is personally identifiable information and why is not sufficient to omit it to make data truly anonymous? How do we assess the risks of re-identification? How do we maintain our participants’ anonymity, when we need to stay in touch with them online? What novel risks are engendered by the massive trail of data we all leave on the web? How do we anonymise already collected data by binning, fuzzing, and omitting? We will also discuss novel technological solutions that can permit us to share data openly: synthetic data generation, scientific use files, or differential privacy algorithms. The workshop consists of some theoretical input, but will also focus on practical exercises. Ideally, participants bring their own laptop with a current R installation. Furthermore, participants can send in questions or typical scenarios from their own research fields in advance.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Transparency vs. privacy. From the Internet Archive Book Images\n\n\n\nSoftware\nI have published a few tools, mostly written in PHP, Javascript, or R, all of which are free to use, and two of which are open source. Missing from this list is one website that I had to take offline because a German dictionary didn’t get the joke and threatened to sue me. Don’t ask. You can find the open source software and some of my reproducible statistical analyses on Github and OSF.\nformr.org\nformr.org is a study framework. Most users use it to run fancy surveys with feedback and control complex studies, such as experience sampling, and longitudinal research. I started working on an early version of this before my PhD and continued developing it during my PhD. Core niceties include that a direct link to R allows users to program studies with fairly unlimited complexity. Cyril Tata and Matthias Walther are helping me develop and maintain the software since 2015 and 2018, respectively. I also wrote an R package simply called formr to help users make the most of the data and metadata.\nIn addition to extensive documentation supplied by us and supplemented by our users in a Wiki, there is also a paper describing the software.\ncodebook\ncodebook is an R package that allows users to document datasets in nice websites that can be read and understood both by co-authors, forgetful future yous, and machines. It was based on a set of convenience functions available in formr. It can make good use of existing metadata, such as item data contained in Qualtrics or formr.org surveys, but also variable and value labels, in Stata, SPSS, and SAS files.\nI wrote a tutorial, but the easiest way to get going is to simply upload a dataset to this webapp. Iro Eleftheriadou created a gallery for codebooks made from datasets uploaded to the Open Science Framework.\nAlphabattle.xyz\nA small collaboration with a friend led to this player-vs-player online word game written with Meteor. You have to infer the other person’s secret word by asking words, but only learning whether letters matched or not. We kept it very similar to the paper-pencil version that we used to play before it became less common to carry paper and pencil than a smartphone.\nbrainfunnel.com\nDuring a year abroad in Sweden in 2005, I tried to speed up my vocabulary learning using spaced repetition and habit forming (I probably learned more PHP and Javascript than Swedish because of this). Because most existing software that I could find was commercial and didn’t work on Macs, I wrote one in the form of a website. I stopped working on this in 2011, but it still works, and I think it might still be the only one with easy support for gap texts.\nPrivacy Policy\nSee here\n\nSome more information about this form can be found here.↩︎\n",

No evidence that inbreeding avoidance is up-regulated during the ovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle.\nTiming: Before publication of preprint, while preparing a revision. The linked preprint still shows the earlier version, but the updated code is available at https://rubenarslan.github.io/fertility_and_kin/.\nReporter: Steve Gangestad\nType of mistake: Coding error that changes a number reported in the supplement\nDescription: I ran a number of robustness checks and automated the steps. When using the update.formula syntax, I made a mistake, in which I removed not only the term from the regression that I wanted to remove, but also another main effect that I wanted to keep, which led to an interaction term being included without the respective main effect.\nDelay: 11 days. Reported February 8, 2021, corrected February 19, 2021.\nSolution: I re-added the main effect. The numbers changed only slightly, the interpretation was not affected.\nFuture Measures: I’m considering writing a better-tested set of functions to run my robustness checks or to look for existing well-tested solutions, to reduce the chance of errors. However, I think given a great number of robustness checks, the probability of errors goes up, and I do not want to respond by reducing the number of robustness checks.\nBounty: 10€ paid to Against Malaria\nArslan et al., 2018\nProject: Arslan et al., 2018. Using 26,000 diary entries to show ovulatory changes in sexual desire and behavior.\nTiming: After publication.\nReporters: Steve Gangestad, Dan Engber, Mike Wood\nType of mistake: Several.\nDescription: See correction at the journal JPSP, extended blog post, follow-up criticism by Gangestad & Dinh, which reports an uncorrected error. We wrote a response to the follow-up critique. Please note that the publicly visible portion of the correction on PsycNet is truncated, so you actually have to download the PDF.\nDelay: Some immediate fixes were released via Twitter, the correction was published in June, 2019. The correction did not correct one further error, which the critical reanalysis, published online in May 2020, reported. Our response to it was published only in October 2021.\nSolution: See links.\nFuture Measures: I increased the time spent on data cleaning, tried to standardize my procedures more (by using my codebook package and better naming schemes for variables). I plan to reproducibly generate figures, tables, and results paragraphs in the future to avoid transcription errors. I introduced my bug bounty policy as a result.\nBounty: Before BB policy.\nArslan et al., 2017\nProject: Arslan et al., 2018. Relaxed selection and mutation accumulation are best studied empirically: reply to Woodley of Menie et al\nTiming: After publication.\nReporter: Anonymous via my Tell Me I’m Wrong form.\nType of mistake: Misquotes.\nDescription: The journal sent us a comment on our paper to respond to, which we did in peer review and in a published response. However, the published comment was a later version than the last one we were sent. As a result, three quotes we highlight do not occur in the comment etc.\nDelay: The journal only allowed the publication of a very brief erratum and massively delayed the response. Our response was published online February 2018, I heard about the misquotes almost immediately and got in touch with the journal in February. The cut erratum appeared online only August 2018.\nSolution: A footnote describes the ordeal. The uncut erratum is here, the published erratum is here.\nFuture Measures: I resolved to always insist on the final version of an article I’m responding to.\nBounty: Before BB policy.\nMinor stuff\nTo remind me who I owe beer.\nhttps://twitter.com/rubenarslan/status/1277637487624675328\nhttps://twitter.com/LL_Wieczorek/status/1117093149250289664\nhttps://twitter.com/rubenarslan/status/1057365698698268672\n\n\n\n",

C., Brümmer, M., Drewelies, J., Dohmen, T., Schupp, J., Wagner, G. G., & Hertwig, R. (in press). How people know their risk preference. Scientific Reports. https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/p5k84.\nPDF. Supplement. OSF.\n\nAbstract\n\nPeople differ in their willingness to take risks. Recent work found that revealed preference tasks (e.g., laboratory lotteries)—a dominant class of measures—are outperformed by survey-based stated preferences, which are more stable and predict real-world risk taking across different domains. How can stated preferences, often criticised as inconsequential “cheap talk,” be more valid and predictive than controlled, incentivized lotteries? In our multimethod study, over 3,000 respondents from population samples answered a single widely used and predictive risk- preference question. Respondents then explained the reasoning behind their answer. They tended to recount diagnostic behaviours and experiences, focusing on voluntary, consequential acts and experiences from which they seemed to infer their risk preference. We found that third- party readers of respondents’ brief memories and explanations reached similar inferences about respondents’ preferences, indicating the intersubjective validity of this information. Our results help unpack the self perception behind stated risk preferences that permits people to draw upon their own understanding of what constitutes diagnostic behaviours and experiences, as revealed in high-stakes situations in the real world.\nRoutinely randomize potential sources of measurement reactivity to estimate and adjust for biases in subjective reports.\n\nFigures\n\n\n\n\n\nArslan, R.
