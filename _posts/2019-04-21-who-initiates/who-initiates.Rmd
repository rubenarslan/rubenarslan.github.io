I'm tempted to say I started writing this post over Easter, because the question
"who initiates sexual behaviour in relationships" seems like a chicken-and-egg-question.
There are no easy answers. Of course, societal expectations and relationship
habits imply that we cannot take whatever answers we find to mean that this translates
to who wants (certain) sex (acts) more. And of course, none of this gets any 
easier given that in our dataset women reported their perceptions of both their
partner and themselves—we did not hear from the partners.

```

But this is just a blog post, so I'll ask you to kindly keep these caveats in mind.^[Lest I sell the data short, the initiation questions do show reasonable associations with a bunch of other questions we asked, see Appendix. However, I have tagged this post a "quick job", so it is excluded from by Bug Bounty program. I still appreciate hearing about errors of course.]

diary <- diary %>% filter(!is.na(sex_active))
diary <- diary %>% 
  mutate(sex_acts = if_na(sex_acts, 0))


cut_common_stem <- function(x) {
  i = 1
  while (i <= max(stringr::str_length(x)) & dplyr::n_distinct(stringr::str_sub(x, 1, i)) == 1) {
    i = i + 1
  }
  stringr::str_sub(x, i)
}


# ggplot(diary, aes(str_wrap(as_factor(contact_partner, "both"),10), sexual_initiation_partner)) + 
  # geom_pointrange(stat = 'summary', fun.data = "mean_se")

diary <- diary %>% 
  group_by(person) %>% 
  filter(sum(!is.na(ended_diary)) > 30,
         hetero_relationship == 1) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  filter(contact_partner < 5)
```

To look at who initiates sex more often, I'll restrict the diary dataset to the `r n_distinct(diary$person)` women who filled out the diary on more than 30 days and who were in a heterosexual relationship. I'll also restrict it to days on which women had seen their partners at least briefly. We asked women in heterosexual relationships to endorse the following specific, awkwardly pointed statements. Because we were trying not to bore our participants out of their minds we only asked these questions on 30% of days.
This still lets me examine `r sum(!is.na(diary$sexual_initiation_self))` days, with sexual activity on `r sum(diary$sex_active == 1 & !is.na(diary$sexual_initiation_self))` of those days.

- My partner initiated sexual acts with me.
- I initiated sexual acts with my partner.

Single women and women who had non-heterosexual relationships filled out detailed questions about their
love lives as well, but we'll leave that for another day. 

## Women and men

```{r fig.cap="As you can maybe already see, women reported their partners initiated sex more often, on average."}

```

```{r fig.cap="By looking at this in two dimensions, we can see a bit more detail.

I don't want to neglect individual differences, but visualising them well is hard! Therefore,
I hid these attempts here.

## By time

In the last post, we looked at sexual activity across the day and week. So, you have
some idea when sex happens. But who initiates sex on these days? Unsurprsingly, it seems both (or more in some cases) parties are initiating sex more on the weekend.

```{r fig.width=8, fig.cap="Are their partners more likely to initiate sex during the week than our participants? The difference does not seem large."}
sex_long_moved <- sex_long %>% 
  mutate(created_date = if_else(time %in% c("t0_yesterday_evening", "t1_before_falling_asleep", "t2_night_time"),
           as.Date(created_diary - hours(6)) - days(1),

What about time of day? In the last post we saw that women reported slightly lower enjoyment for morning sex on average. Here, we see a corresponding gap in initiation. However, we also see a gap for daytime sex and we saw no enjoyment gap there. I'm very interested in your theories (or literature) why these gaps turn out differently.

```{r fig.width=8, fig.cap="Interesting difference! It may seem odd that average initiation goes down in the evening, even though people have more sex in the evening, but remember that I can only plot sex according to time conditional on having sex. I don't know exactly what everyone is doing at night, but maybe sex 'just happens' more often? Or the kind of people who only have sex in the evenings are less likely to strongly endorse the initiation items. Complicated, huh? I'm lucky this is just a blog post.", preview = TRUE}

## Who initiates which acts?

Now, we did not ask for each sexual act who initiated it. That kind of play-by-play just did not seem like a reasonable thing to ask. Still, it might be fun to look at the initiation on each day by the kind of sex people had on that day.

```{r layout="l-body-outset",fig.width=10, fig.cap="First, we can look at raw means."}
# summary(mod <- lme4::lmer(value ~ who * (weekday + time +  
#                             sex_activity_anal_sex + sex_activity_bdsm_sub + sex_activity_cuddling +
#                             sex_activity_cunnilingus + sex_activity_fellatio + sex_activity_kissing +
#                             sex_activity_masturbated_by_partner + sex_activity_masturbated_partner +
#                             sex_activity_masturbation + sex_activity_toys + 
#                             sex_with_other_female + sex_with_other_male + sex_nr) + (1 | person) + (1 | person:created_diary), data = sex_long_moved %>% 
#           gather(who, value, sexual_initiation_self, sexual_initiation_partner) %>% 
#             rename(person = short)))

sex_long_by_who <- sex_long_moved %>% 
  gather(act, value, starts_with("sex_activity")) %>% 
  drop_na(sexual_initiation_self) %>% 
  filter(value == 1, sex_active_partnered == 1) %>% 
  mutate(act = cut_common_stem(act)) %>% 
  group_by(act) %>% 
  filter(n() > 30) %>% 
  mutate(mean_sexual_initiation_self = mean(sexual_initiation_self, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup() %>% 
  arrange(desc(mean_sexual_initiation_self)) %>% 
  mutate(act = forcats::fct_inorder(forcats::fct_drop(act))) %>%
  gather(who, value, sexual_initiation_self, sexual_initiation_partner) %>% 
  mutate(who = forcats::fct_infreq(who),
         time = forcats::fct_infreq(time),
         sex_nr = forcats::fct_infreq(sex_nr)
         )
sex_long_by_who %>% 
  rename(`Sex act` = act) %>% 
ggplot(aes(`Sex act`, value, color = who)) +
  geom_pointrange(stat = 'summary', fun.data = 'mean_se', position = position_dodge(width = 0.2)) +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_color_viridis_d(end = 0.5) +
  scale_y_continuous("Value", limits = c(0,4), breaks = 0:4, labels = c("0\nnot at all",1:3, "4\nvery much"))
```

Now, looking at raw means ignores that certain sex acts are more likely to be performed in the evenings or on weekends and that they co-occur. We already saw these factors have something to do with initiation as well. I'm not sure what the best model is to take all this into account. I'm happy for better suggestions!

Some activities trade ranks, but fellatio and BDSM (submissive)^[This response meant engaging in some BDSM play in a submissive role. It was also possible to specify BDSM play in a dominant role, but that fell below my arbitrary cutoff of at least 30 observed acts] stay at the top. Fellatio is the only act where we see almost no gap in initiation.

```{r layout="l-body-outset",fig.width=10,fig.cap="What do we get when we adjust for these other factors and between-individual differences in an ad-hoc model?"}
mod <- lme4::lmer(value ~ who * (weekday + time +  act + sex_nr) + (1 | short), data = sex_long_by_who)
library(effects)
x <- effect( "who:act", mod)
x %>% 
as_tibble() %>% 
  group_by(act) %>% 
  mutate(mean = mean(fit[who == "sexual_initiation_self"], na.rm = TRUE)) %>%

  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(`Sex act` = forcats::fct_inorder(forcats::fct_drop(act))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(`Sex act`, fit, color = who, ymin = lower, ymax = upper)) + 
  coord_flip() +
  geom_pointrange(position = position_dodge(width = 0.2)) +
  scale_color_viridis_d(end = 0.5) +
  scale_y_continuous("Value", limits = c(0,4), breaks = 0:4, labels = c("0\nnot at all",1:3, "4\nvery much"))
```

```{r layout="l-body-outset",fig.width=10,fig.cap="We can also limit the data to only days on which no sexual acts were combined."}
sex_long_by_who %>% 
  group_by(short, created_diary, who) %>% 
  filter(2 == n()) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  rename(`Sex act` = act) %>% 
ggplot(aes(`Sex act`, value, color = who)) +

```


So, this is a first look at the question who initiates (what kind of) sex. I had a busy week, so this is
just quick and dirty.^[But let me know if you want to see a graph I could add.] I plan to analyse sexual initiation across the menstrual cycle at some point, so it was good to do some sanity checks with this data.

## Self-reported initiation—not total nonsense, maybe? {.appendix} 

Part of the reason for doing this blog post was seeing whether the items we used give reasonable results. I did not want to bore you with these sanity checks, but I'm also not good at deleting graphs either.
