<p>After his talk at the Center for Adaptive Rationality, <a href="https://twitter.com/STWorg">Stephan Lewandowsky</a> and I had a small discussion whether scientists can actually pick “winners”. The discussion stemmed from a larger discussion about whether we get more research waste, if we replicate first, then publish, or publish first, and then replicate those studies that are found interesting.</p>
<p>If I recall correctly, we didn’t really disagree that scientists <em>can</em> tell if things are off about a study, but we did disagree on whether <em>citation</em> indexes such a quality assessment, and is a useful way to find out which studies are worthy of more attention.</p>
<p>So, I ran the numbers for one of the few <a href="https://osf.io/fgjvw">studies</a> where we can find out, the Reproducibility Project: Psychology. I <a href="https://twitter.com/rubenarslan/status/996782368890544132">tweeted it back then</a>, but felt like making the graphs nicer and playing with <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/radix/">radix</a> on a train ride.</p>

<strong>Details</strong>: I got DOIs, which were missing from the RPP data, by searching Crossref on titles, authors, and dates. I did some checking to see if matches were proper. Next, I got citation counts from Scopus and validated those against those in the RPP and Crossref. Find the improved dataset with DOIs below.
</aside>
<p>I used the Crossref API to get DOIs and the Scopus API to get yearly citation counts for the papers contained in the RPP.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> The SCOPUS citation count up to 2015 was highly correlated with the one stored in the dataset (based on Google Scholar). Rank order were also very similar for citations pre and post 2015 using Scopus, CrossRef, or Google Scholar. However, subtracting CrossRef citation counts from Google Scholar counts amplified error (to get citations after the publication of the RPP) - the correlation with the “citations after 2015 (Scopus)” variable was low. Therefore, the revised version of this blog post uses only the Scopus numbers.</p>
<p>Again, there was no association with replication status for 2018 citation counts.</p>

<p>The correlation between 2018 Scopus and 2015 Google Scholar counts is 0.97, but the means differ (2018 Scopus = 72, Scholar 2015 = 90). Can citations go <em>down</em>? No, but Google Scholar includes more sources than Scopus, leading to the mean being higher. Still, these sources don’t seem to be systematically different, leading to the maintained rank order.</p>

<p><strike>This is pretty dirty work, because I’m subtracting citation counts from one source with another, so most papers are cited less in 2018 than in 2015. But haven’t found a quick way to get citation counts in 2015 from <code>rcrossref</code>. I’ve requested the necessary access to Scopus, where I could check, but Elsevier is being annoying.</strike></p>
<p><strike>Again, no association. So, assuming the dirtiness of the analysis doesn’t matter, </strike></p>

<h3 id="what-about-self-citations">What about self citations?</h3>
<p>The RPP emphasised its own overall result. Hence, some nonreplications of specific studies may have gone unnoticed by researchers in the field. But the study authors hardly have this excuse; they knew whether their study was replicated (probably even prior to 2015, but this is hard to figure out). However, there is also no significant difference in self citation count (before or after 2015) by publication status.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, are citation counts a poor indicator of quality? The most common reaction I received to these results was saying that the 7 years from the publication of the studies to 2015 are probably not enough for citation counts to become more signal than noise, or at least that the 3 years from the publication of the RPP results to 2018 are not enough. These reactions mostly came from people who did not really believe in citations-as-merit before anyway.</p>
<p>To me, if 10 years after publication citations cannot be used to distinguish between studies that replicated and those that didn’t, they’re probably not a useful measure of thoroughness that can be used in assessment, hiring, and so on. They may be a useful measure of other important skills for a scientist, such as communicating their work; they may measure qualities we don’t want in scientists, but it seems they are not useful to select people whose work will replicate. I think that is something we should want to do.</p>
<p>In addition, the literature does not react quickly to the fact that studies do not replicate. Given that people also keep citing retracted studies (albeit with a sharp drop), this does not surprise me. It will be interesting to revisit the data in a few years time and see if researchers picked up on replication status then.</p>
<h3 id="limitations">Limitations</h3>
<p>These were all studies from reputable journals, so we might have some range restriction here. On the other hand, plenty of these studies don’t replicate, and citation counts go from 0 to &gt;300.</p>

<p>These analyses are based on Chris J. Hartgerink’s script. The data and his script can be found on the <a href="https://osf.io/ytpuq/">OSF</a>. Did I get the right DOIs? There are probably still some mismatches. Titles are not exactly equal for 84 studies, but on manual inspection this is only because Crossref separates out the subtitle, and 150 of 167 titles start exactly the same.</p>
