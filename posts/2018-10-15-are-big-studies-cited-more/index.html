<div class="d-article">
<p>After asking whether studies that replicate are cited more and finding that this is not the case, I turned to a different analysis that I once did quickly. Namely, I reviewed the <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0109019">N-pact paper</a> by Chris Fraley and Simine Vazire back in 2014. I got excited about the paper, as I’m wont to, and tried redoing their analyses because they had provided the data with their manuscript. I also decided to see if I could find a relationship at the article level as well.</p>

<p>Again, we first needed to get the DOIs by querying the Crossref API. Using the DOIs, we could next get the citation counts. We found 1028 DOIs out of 1042 studies.</p>
<h2 id="reproducing-the-original-result">Reproducing the original result</h2>
<p>Here, I first checked whether I would obtain the same measure as Fraley &amp; Vazire did, when I simply averaged the citations to the articles in this set for each year and journal. Interestingly, I could not, or at least it was substantially weakened. I’m pretty sure that when I did this in 2014, I could reproduce the finding. As you can also see, the association is even weaker when using medians for the citation counts instead of means. However, I can still reproduce their original result with the Thomson-Reuters Impact Factors that I quickly googled. I know the Impact Factor isn’t just a simple metric, but a shady business including some <a href="http://bjoern.brembs.net/2016/01/just-how-widespread-are-impact-factor-negotiations/">negotiation</a>. Do journal executives sometimes try a pity move, asking for a higher impact factor by highlighting paltry poor sample sizes? It’s impossible to prove this never happened ;-)!</p>

<h2 id="moving-to-the-study-level">Moving to the study level</h2>
<p>Fraley &amp; Vazire were interested in highlighting how impact factors do not track a no-nonsense aspect of study quality (all else equal, bigger N is simply better). So, they focused on journals. But I, having recently invested a lot of time into obtaining large samples, was curious to see whether these efforts translated into any sort of citation advantage, and more generally, whether we pay more attention to research that is presumably more reliable.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<h2 id="by-year-of-publication">By year of publication</h2>
<p>Maybe it takes us some time to notice how paltry a sample size was?<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Or maybe early citations are all about the glamour and flair, but over time the best and biggest studies win out?</p>

<p>Maybe we don’t see an association between N and citations in Psychological Science, because some small-N papers are solid vision studies with good power within-subject? In the analysis by journal, we see that there is no association between sample size and number of citations within each journal, including some that focus on personality research only, which is a pretty N-driven area.</p>

<p>There isn’t really any perceptible time trend in sample size,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> but it still seems worthwhile to divide the citation count by number of years until 2018 to see whether that makes a difference.</p>

<h2 id="so-how-does-sample-size-relate-to-citation-counts">So, how does sample size relate to citation counts?</h2>
<p>There seems to be pretty much <em>nothing</em> there! Maybe we can come up with a post-hoc narrative by looking at all studies and seeing which studies are cited a lot and have large or small samples.</p>
<p>Hover your mouse over the dots to see the study titles. Jean Twenge with her humongous name study is hiding behind the legend, scroll to find her.</p>
<p>My current favourite post-hoc narrative is that citation counts are just very poor measures of importance. I wouldn’t bet that a better measure of importance would correlate with sample size, but I’m fairly convinced by now that citation counts just suck as a metric even of the thing they’re meant to index (impact/importance). I am especially worried about the difference simple citation counts make between a study that is synthesised in a review that then gets cited a lot<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> and a study that doesn’t get synthesised in a review. I tried to make <a href="http://www.the100.ci/2018/06/26/the-tyranny-of-metrics-in-science-evaluation/">the case for a better, more PageRank-y metric</a>, but it would already be interesting to redo my analysis here and from the previous blog post after excluding self citations. Unfortunately, Elsevier still hasn’t given me Scopus API access, and I lack the chops to do anything more fancy. I really hope projects like the <a href="http://opencitations.net/">Open Citations Corpus</a> lead to such fancy metrics becoming available.</p>

<h3 id="limitations">Limitations</h3>
<p>Well, there are some vision studies in here that used a within-subject paradigm and probably had adequate power for the question they asked anyway. Their small sample size may limit generalizability to other people, but I guess that’s not the dominant question asked in vision science.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> But then again, for some pure-personality journals, we also find no association. There is of course the possibility that studies with very large Ns are more likely to use abbreviated measures, only self-report, and online samples. But then, they are also more likely to be from representative panel studies and online samples aren’t actually any less representative than lab samples. It seems unlikely that any disadvantages exactly balance out with the advantages associated with sample size, so that we arrive at a zero correlation with importance.</p>
